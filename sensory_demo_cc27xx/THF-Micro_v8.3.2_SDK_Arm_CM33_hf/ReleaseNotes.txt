TrulyHandsFree-Micro™ (THF-Micro™) Release Notes
Version: 8.3.2

The following files are included:
- data: Sample acoustic models and audio files.
  - data/model/VoiceHub/ contains VoiceHub models.
  - data/model/Handtuned/ contains hand-tuned models.
  - data/wav/ conains phrase utterances, used for input to THF-Micro™.
  - The included .c files can be used to put models in code (rather than reading from .bin).
  - Supported target formats for models: pc38w, pc40w, pc60w, and pc62w (pass one of these to spot-convert).
  - pc38 and pc40 will not work with multiple channels or depth (C > 1 or D > 1).

- demo: Demonstrate THF-Micro™ API usage for simple wake-word recognition use-case. 
  - Includes emulation project using IAR Embedded Workbench for ARM.
  - demo/SensoryDemo.c implements a simple speech recognizer using file-based audio input.
  - demo/SensoryDemoMulti.c implements a multi-channel speech recognizer using file-based audio input.
  - demo/SensoryDemoHelper.h contains declarations for demo helper functions.
  - demo/SensoryDemoHelper.c contains definitions for demo helper functions.

- docs: THF-Micro™ development guide, see docs/index.html.
  - Starting from version 8.0.0, THF-Micro™ has a new API. See docs/THF-Micro_v8_Changes.pdf.

- include: Required header files to build a THF-Micro™ application.
  - include/sensorylib.h
  - include/sensorytypes.h

- lib: Pre-built THF-Micro™ libraries optimized for Arm Cortex-M33.
  - lib/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10.3-2021.10/libTHFMicro_v8.3.2.a
  - lib/iar-ewarm-9.20.2/libTHFMicro_v8.3.2.a

Version 8.3.2
Fix WWPQ and Stage3 buffering.Fix WWPQ and Stage3 buffering.

Version 8.3.1
Fix issue with no audio buffer and depth > 1.

Version 8.3.0
Fix rare issue with possibly correct recognitions getting discarded.

Version 8.2.2
Fix issue with multiple recognitions and depth >= 2.

Version 8.2.0
- Improve memory usage for SPP (10-20% space benefit).
- May also improve processing time, depending on caching.
- Remove need for SensoryProcessRestart after recognition.
- Enable Speaker Verification (SV) with multiple channels/depth.

Version 8.1.0
- Remove redundant appStruct_T. Moved the 2 remaining members into t2siStruct.
- Functions that used to take appStruct_T* now take t2siStruct* instead.
- LPSD is now permitted with multiple frames.
- Fix issue in reporting endpoints with depth > 1.
- Fix issue where very-high-scoring recos could be off.

Version 8.0.0
- Can process multiple channels and/or multiple frames in the same channel - in one call. 
- See SensoryAllocMulti, SensoryProcessMultiData, SensoryGetResult.
- This saves on memory load time for relatively slow model memory.
- SV cannot be used in multi-processing mode.
- LPSD functions are hidden now, since user does not need to call them.
- Audio functions are hidden now (no more appAudio.c) since user does not need to call them.
- Audio is now handled internally but user can still assign an audio buffer if desired.
- No need to call SensoryFindEndpoint and SensoryFindStartpoint now.
- Most results formerly in t2siStruct are now in RecoResult structure.

Version 7.4.2:
Fix WWPQ and Stage3 buffering.

Version 7.4.1:
"Stage 3" support for additional accuracy with some models.

Version 7.4:
Add licensing info for THF-Micro™ library and model.

Version 7.3.1:
Report recognition status (pending, success, failed etc.). This enables arbitration between multiple recognizers.

Version 7.2.0:
- Wake-To-Command handling improved.
- Now SensoryProcessFeatures can be used in the case of multiple compatible recognizers,
  to speed up processing by using already-created features.

Version 7.1.0:
A phrase inside another phrase is now permitted (e.g. "wake up" and "wake up now").

Version 7.0.0:
- Now no special handling is needed for post-process rejection (so called "NNPQ").
- Models with wider context can now be used.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Licensing and Usage Limits: 
- The included libraries enforce event/usage limits and are intended for development purposes only. 
- The SDK returns error code ERR_LICENSE (0xFF) when a limit is reached. 
- Restarting the device will reset the event limits. 
- Event limits include:
    a) Duration limit: 11.43 hours
    b) Number of Recognitions limit: 107
